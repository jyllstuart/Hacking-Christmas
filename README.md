Hacking old and public domain Christmas Carols with Sonic-Pi (and others) for remixing and xLights sequencing.

## Target Software

While there are other code-based music creation environments, the desired target software is [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/). There are ports that run on both Mac, Windows, and Raspberry Pi.
